\section{Abstract}
\label{sect:abstract}
PyBank is an interactive Python GUI application that simulates a desktop client for personal banking. The application will contain a number of common banking processes such as creating a new banking account, checking account information, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and some analytical analysis related to an accounts spending over time. However, where most banking applications provide information only through text, this application will additionally provide a graphical method through which users may view their data. The application will utilize the principles of human-computer interaction such as the Fundamental Principles of Interaction~\cite{THE_DESIGN_OF_EVERYDAY_THINGS:1} and the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design~\cite{DESIGNING_THE_USER_INTERFACE:2} so that the application provides an enjoyable experience to its end-users.
