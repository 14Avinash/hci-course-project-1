    \subsubsection*{Environment}
    \begin{centering}
        John, an accountant for a local firm, typically performs work on a desktop computer system. He's a busy individual, handling the accounts of both local and widespread businesses. John's spends the majority of his time performing financial computations, answering phones, and writing complex reports with visualizations. Sometimes, when John has to travel, he performs work-related tasks on a laptop computer system instead of other mobile alternatives because he always wants to have the highest performance while working for his clients.
    \end{centering}
    \subsubsection*{Scenario}
    \begin{centering}
        John recently began merging all of his clients accounts into to the PyBank desktop application. During a recent trip, where internet activity was scarce, John was prepared. Thanks to Pybank, John was still able to perform accounting tasks for his clients that were processed, recorded, and once he regained internet access, updated in the cloud. PyBank's flexibility and accessibility allowed John to perform work that other individuals were restricted from performing with traditional banking systems.

    \subsubsection*{Environment}
    \begin{centering}
        Jane is a freelance financial analyst who prefers to work remotely. Her work is generally done on a laptop since she often enjoys working at the coffee shop or other social venues. Jane prefers summarized data visualizations that help her make quick analytical interpretations.
    \end{centering}
    \subsubsection*{Scenario}
    \begin{centering}
        Recently, at Jane's favorite local coffee shop, Jane decided that she wanted to analyzer her families' personal finances and present the results to her husband in an easy to understand manner. With this goal in mind she focused on creating histograms and pie charts for categorical data and a line graph for plotting her families spending over time. With the help of PyBank, she was able to generate these visualizations and produce a summary of her families spending in no time, all while consuming her favorite coffee drink!
