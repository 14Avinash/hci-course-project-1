PyBank, an interactive Python GUI application, simulates a desktop client for personal banking. The application will contain a number of common banking processes such as creating an a new banking account, checking account information, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and some analytical analysis related to an accounts spending over time. The goal of this application, beyond simulating common banking processes, is to implement principles of human-computer interaction such as the Fundamental Principles of Interaction~\cite{THE_DESIGN_OF_EVERYDAY_THINGS:1} and the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design~\cite{DESIGNING_THE_USER_INTERFACE:2} so that the application provides an enjoyable experience to its end-users.
